Key Improvements in the Refactored Script
🏗️ Clean Modular Architecture
Before: All database code mixed into automation script
After: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules:

System Hardening Module - OS security, firewall, SSH
Docker Installation Module - Container platform setup
Project Structure Module - Directory creation and secrets
Database Module Integration - Calls external database script
API Services Module - Application layer setup
Monitoring Module - Observability stack
Reverse Proxy Module - Nginx configuration

🔗 Smart Integration Pattern
The script now calls your dedicated database setup script rather than duplicating code:
bashsetup_database_layer() {
log "Setting up database infrastructure..."

    # Check if database setup script exists
    local db_script="$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/database-setup.sh"

    if [[ ! -f "$db_script" ]]; then
        warning "Database setup script not found. Creating it..."
        create_database_setup_script
    fi

    # Execute database setup
    log "Executing dedicated database setup script..."
    if "$db_script"; then
        success "Database layer configured successfully"
    else
        error "Database setup failed"
    fi

}
⚙️ Flexible Execution Options
You can now run specific modules independently:
bash# Full installation
./automation-script.sh complete

# Just system hardening

./automation-script.sh system-only

# Just database setup

./automation-script.sh database-only

# Just API services

./automation-script.sh api-only

# Validate current setup

./automation-script.sh validate

Migration Strategy

Replace your current automation script with this refactored version
Keep your comprehensive database-setup.sh exactly as is
The automation script will automatically call the database script when needed
Add the new management utilities for ongoing operations

Benefits of This Approach
✅ No Code Duplication - Database logic lives in one place
✅ Independent Testing - Each module can be tested separately
✅ Easier Maintenance - Updates to database schema don't affect system hardening
✅ Flexible Deployment - Teams can run only what they need
✅ Better Error Handling - Failures isolated to specific modules
✅ Cleaner Dependencies - Clear execution order and prerequisites
Usage Examples
bash# Full platform installation
sudo ./automation-script.sh complete

# Update just the database layer

sudo ./automation-script.sh database-only

# Check if everything is working

./automation-script.sh validate

# Manage the platform after installation

risk-platform start
risk-platform status
risk-platform logs api
This refactored approach gives you the best of both worlds: a comprehensive automation script for full deployments, plus the flexibility to work with individual components when needed. The database setup remains completely independent while being seamlessly integrated into the larger automation workflow.
