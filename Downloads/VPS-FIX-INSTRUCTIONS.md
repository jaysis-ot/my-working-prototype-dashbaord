We need to create the brand-new file VPS-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md. It must
• Explain what went wrong (duplicate APT sources, package conflicts).
• Describe solution approach (clean sources, switch to ufw, fix iptables-persistent conflict).
• Provide step-by-step fix & continuation using the two scripts delivered (vps-apt-fix.sh and continue-vps-deployment.sh).
• Summarise what each script does.
• Give next steps, verification, emergency recovery.

No other files to output. Produce well-structured markdown with headings, numbered steps, code blocks (without ``` tags because inside file is fine).
